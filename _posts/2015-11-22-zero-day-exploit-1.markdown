Julia, Sysadmin for <em>Bik&uuml;rious Delivery</em>, gets woken up at 4am Wednesday morning. There's an alley-cat at 9am and a new Zero-Day Exploit has just been announced on the feeds. Will she be able to find a fix and have time to patch all of the bikes before the race?

<strong>Series begins in January 2018.</strong>
